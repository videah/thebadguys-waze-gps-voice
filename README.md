This repo serves as an archive for The Bad Guys 2 promotional Waze sidekick pack, featuring a plethora of Mr Wolf voice lines for GPS navigation and some artwork of his car and his uh, head as a car?

These files were obtained from a rooted Android emulator and inspection of HTTP requests between the Waze app and their CDN.

>[!NOTE] The archive is currently missing different angles of his car as I could not find it in local storage or through HTTP requests, if you have a better understanding of Waze than I do and can provide the assets for the car I'd really appreciate it!

All rights for these probably fall to Dreamworks, who I am politely pleading to leave this repo up as fans of the series will really appreciate them and it would be a shame to lose once the promotion is finished.
